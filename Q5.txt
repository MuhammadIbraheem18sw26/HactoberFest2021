Q5:What are the various access specifiers in Java?
There are four types of access specifier/modifiers in JAVA.
1.Private: We can access the private modifier only within the same class and not from outside the class.

2.Default: We can access the default modifier only within the same package and not from outside the package.
  And also, if we do not specify any access modifier it will automatically consider it as default.

3.Protected: We can access the protected modifier within the same package and also from outside the package with the help of the child class.
  If we do not make the child class, we cannot access it from outside the package. So inheritance is a must for accessing it from outside the package.

4.Public: We can access the public modifier from anywhere. We can access public modifiers from within the class as well as from outside the class and
  also within the package and from outside the package.
